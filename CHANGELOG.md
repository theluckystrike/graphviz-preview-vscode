# Changelog

## 0.1.3 (2026-11-07)

- The Marketplace name is now "Graphviz Viewer & DOT Viewer (Live Preview)" (it was "Graphviz Preview & DOT Viewer"), so it matches what people type in the Extensions search. The extension id, commands and settings stay the same.
- The Marketplace description now starts with "Graphviz viewer and DOT viewer for ".
- Marketplace search keywords updated, with the phrases people search for first.

## 0.1.2 (2026-11-07)

- "More free viewers" now starts with the Zovo extensions most related to this one. Picking one opens its Marketplace page, where you choose to install it.
- The README has a "Support Zovo" section with GitHub Sponsors and the developer's GitHub profile, and "More tools by Zovo" lists related extensions.

## 0.1.1 (2026-11-06)

- A thin line under the graph has two links, "Sponsor" (GitHub Sponsors) and "More free viewers". The new setting `graphvizPreview.showSupportLinks` (default `true`) hides it, and so does the "Hide" link next to them. The Markdown preview never shows it. There is no popup, and nothing is sent anywhere.
- New commands "Graphviz: Support the developer" and "Graphviz: More free viewers". The second one lists the other Zovo extensions and installs only the one you pick. Ones that are not on the Marketplace yet open their GitHub page.
- The listing gets a Sponsor button. The README has a short Support section and lists all Zovo extensions.
- The "More free viewers" list and the README list now show the 15 Zovo extensions on the Marketplace under their current names, and 11 that are coming soon.
- Extensions for related files now come first, starting with Large JSON Viewer & JSON Tree.
